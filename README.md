# AutoGG

## This is an extension of the original AutoGG by 2pi.

### Only adds:
* 1.14 support through Fabric
* Support for custom messages

Everything rewritten is under the package `dev.xyze.autogg`. Anything that was simply modified to work remains in its original spot.

#### For 1.14 support the following was done:
* Rewrite events as mixins
* Rewrite commands to support Brigadier
* Change imports to match those of Yarn

#### To add custom message support the following was done:
* Rewrite config file to use a JSON format
* Change commands/mod init to support writing/reading this new format

### Can I get banned with this?
This mod currently breaks the "no macros" rule of the modifications guideline, however, with normal usage of this mod, there shouldn't be anything detectable or anything that gives an advantage against someone without this mod
